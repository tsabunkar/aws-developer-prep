# Simple Notification Service (SNS)

- Amazon Simple Notification Service is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud
- It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexible, and cost-effective capability to publish messages from an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or other applications.
- We can push notifications to apple, google, Fire OS and windows devices, as well as android devices.
- Besides pushing cloud notifications directly to mobile devices, Amazon SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text message or email to Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) eueues or to any HTTP endpoint
- SNS notifications can also trigger lambda functions:
  - when a message is published to an SNS topic that has a lambda functions subscribed to it, the lambda functions is invoked with the payload of the published message.
  - The lambda function receives the message payload as input parameter and can manipulate the information in the message, publish the message to another SNS topic, or send the message to other AWS services.
- SNS allows you to group multiple recipients using topics, A topic is an "access point" for allowing recipients to dynamically subscribe for identical copies of the same notification.
- One topic can support deliveries to multiple endpoint types- for example, you can group together iOS, Android and SMS recipients. When you publish once to a topic, SNS delivers appropriately formatted copies of your message to each subscirber
- To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are stored redundantly across multiple avaliability zones
- SNS Benefits:
  - Instantaneous, push-based delivery (no polling)
  - Simple APIs and easy integration with applications
  - Flexible message delivery over muliple transport protocols
  - Inexpensive, pay-as-you-go model with no up-front costs
  - Web-based AWS Management console offers the simplicity of a point-and-click interface
- SNS v/s SQS

- SNS pricing
  - Users pay \$0.50 per 1 million SNS requests
  - \$0.06 per 100,000 notification deliveries over HTTP
  - \$0.75 per 100 notification deliveries over SMS

- SNS
  - Amazon SNS follow the "publish-subscribe" (pub-sub) messaging paradigm, with notifications being delivered to clients using a "push" mechanism that eliminates the need to periodically check or "poll" for new information and updates
  - With simple APIs requiring minimal up-front development effort, no maintaince or management overhead and pay-as-you-go, Amazon SNS gives developers an easy mechanism to incorporate a powerful notification system with their applications
- Exam Tips:
  - SNS is scalable and highly available notification servie which allows you to send push notifications from the cloud
  - Variety of message formats supported: SMS text message, email, Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues, any HTTP endpoint.
  - Pub-Sub model whereby users subscribe to topics
  - It is a push mechanism, rather than a pull (poll) mechanism
